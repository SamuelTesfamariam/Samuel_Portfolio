# [**Project 1: Forecasting the Global Price of Metal Index using ARIMA Model**](https://github.com/SamuelTesfamariam/Metal-Price-Index-Forecast)
1. Streamed data from FRED for the global index of metal prices (ticker: PMETAINDEXM)
2. Run an Augmented Dicky Fuller test (ADF) to test for Unit root
    - Here I used the Ender's approach to test for unit root.
    - I also transformed the data as needed to achieve stationarity in the series
3. Estimated an ARIMA(1, 1, 1) model after comparing different models
4. Run a test prediction on a hold-out sample (test data) for a forecast vs. actuals comparison
5. Finally made a six month forecast for the series.
